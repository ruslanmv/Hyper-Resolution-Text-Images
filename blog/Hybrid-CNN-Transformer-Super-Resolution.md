# Super Resolution of Unstructured Text in Low-Resolution Images Using Hybrid Transformer-CNN Architectures

Super-resolution techniques are critical in improving the quality of low-resolution images, especially those containing text. Images with unstructured text often suffer from poor legibility, and traditional super-resolution methods might not yield optimal results. Hybrid architectures, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, offer powerful solutions for such cases.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a Python pipeline for super-resolution using two models:
1. **TTSR (Text Transformer Super-Resolution)**: A transformer-based model designed for enhancing text clarity.
2. **U-Net + Transformers**: A hybrid architecture that captures both small and large-scale details for overall image enhancement.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

We will use PyTorch for deep learning operations and OpenCV for handling image data.

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

We'll begin by importing all the required libraries for handling images, building the models, and running the super-resolution process.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision import models
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from transformers import ViTModel, ViTConfig
```

## Step 2: Load and Preprocess the Image

The first step is to load the low-resolution image that contains unstructured text. We will use OpenCV for this task and resize the image to a standard shape for processing.

```python
def load_image(image_path, size=(256, 256)):
    # Load the image using OpenCV
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    # Resize the image to the desired size
    img = cv2.resize(img, size)
    return img

def preprocess_image(img):
    # Normalize the image and convert to tensor for PyTorch processing
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    ])
    img = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension
    return img

# Load and preprocess the low-resolution image
image_path = "low_res_text_image.jpg"
low_res_img = load_image(image_path)
input_img = preprocess_image(low_res_img)
```

## Step 3: Define the TTSR Model (Text Transformer Super-Resolution)

TTSR leverages the Transformer architecture to capture text-specific features and enhance the clarity of low-resolution text images. We'll define a simplified version of the TTSR model using Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone.

```python
class TTSR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TTSR, self).__init__()
        # Vision Transformer for extracting global features
        self.transformer = ViTModel.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
        # Upsample to higher resolution
        self.upsample = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
        # Convolution layers to refine the upsampled image
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(768, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(256, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 3, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Extract features using transformer
        features = self.transformer(x).last_hidden_state
        # Upsample the features
        upsampled = self.upsample(features.permute(0, 2, 1).reshape(-1, 768, 16, 16))
        # Refine the upsampled image using convolution layers
        x = nn.ReLU()(self.conv1(upsampled))
        x = nn.ReLU()(self.conv2(x))
        out = self.conv3(x)
        return out

# Initialize TTSR model
ttsr_model = TTSR()
```

## Step 4: Define U-Net + Transformers Model

Next, we'll define a hybrid architecture that combines U-Net, which captures fine local features, with Transformers, which capture larger contextual information.

```python
class UNetTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(UNetTransformer, self).__init__()
        # Encoder using standard CNN layers
        self.enc1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.enc2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        
        # Transformer for capturing global context
        self.transformer = ViTModel.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
        
        # Decoder using CNN layers
        self.dec1 = nn.Conv2d(128, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.dec2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 3, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.upsample = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoding path with convolutions
        x1 = nn.ReLU()(self.enc1(x))
        x2 = nn.ReLU()(self.enc2(self.pool(x1)))

        # Pass the encoded features through the Transformer
        transformer_features = self.transformer(x).last_hidden_state

        # Decode with upsampling and convolution layers
        x = self.upsample(transformer_features.permute(0, 2, 1).reshape(-1, 128, 16, 16))
        x = nn.ReLU()(self.dec1(x))
        out = self.dec2(x)
        return out

# Initialize U-Net + Transformer model
unet_transformer_model = UNetTransformer()
```

## Step 5: Run Inference on Low-Resolution Image

Now that we have both models defined, we can run them on the low-resolution image to generate a super-resolved output.

```python
def enhance_image(model, input_img):
    model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode
    with torch.no_grad():
        output_img = model(input_img)
    return output_img.squeeze(0).cpu().permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()

# Enhance using TTSR
output_ttsr = enhance_image(ttsr_model, input_img)

# Enhance using U-Net + Transformer
output_unet_transformer = enhance_image(unet_transformer_model, input_img)
```

## Step 6: Display the Results

We can now visualize the results of both models, comparing the original low-resolution image with the enhanced versions.

```python
def display_images(low_res_img, ttsr_img, unet_img):
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
    
    # Original Low-Resolution Image
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
    plt.imshow(low_res_img)
    plt.title("Low-Resolution Image")
    
    # TTSR Enhanced Image
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
    plt.imshow(np.clip(ttsr_img, 0, 1))
    plt.title("TTSR Enhanced Image")
    
    # U-Net + Transformer Enhanced Image
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
    plt.imshow(np.clip(unet_img, 0, 1))
    plt.title("U-Net + Transformer Enhanced Image")
    
    plt.show()

# Display the comparison
display_images(low_res_img, output_ttsr, output_unet_transformer)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we built a Python pipeline for performing super-resolution on unstructured text in low-resolution images using hybrid Transformer-CNN architectures. We implemented two models:
- **TTSR (Text Transformer Super-Resolution)**, designed specifically for enhancing text clarity.
- **U-Net + Transformers**, a combination that captures fine-grained local details and global context.

Both models can be adapted and fine-tuned for various applications, and they provide excellent results for improving image quality where traditional CNN-based methods may fall short.
