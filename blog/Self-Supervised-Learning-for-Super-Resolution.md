# Super-Resolution of Text Images Using Self-Supervised Learning (SimCLR/BYOL) in Python

In this blog post, we’ll explore how to implement image super-resolution using **self-supervised learning** techniques like **SimCLR** or **BYOL**. Super-resolution is the task of reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) ones, and we will apply it to images containing unstructured text, making the low-resolution text clearer and readable.

## Introduction to Self-Supervised Learning

**Self-Supervised Learning** (SSL) has made significant strides in tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation. SSL methods like **SimCLR** (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) and **BYOL** (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) don't require labeled data and rely on augmentations to learn representations. These models are perfect for solving the task of super-resolution because the model can learn to transform low-quality images into high-resolution ones without needing a labeled dataset.

### Why Self-Supervised for Super-Resolution?

- **Data-Efficient**: No need for labeled images; SSL can learn from any set of low-resolution images.
- **Better Generalization**: The model can generalize better on unseen images.
- **Feature Learning**: SSL methods can help the model learn important features of text even when the resolution is low.

## Steps to Build the Super-Resolution Model

We will focus on the following steps:

1. **Prepare the Environment**
2. **Dataset Preparation**
3. **SimCLR/BYOL Implementation for Feature Extraction**
4. **Training the Super-Resolution Model**
5. **Image Reconstruction**
6. **Inference on New Images**

Let's dive into each of these steps.

### 1. Prepare the Environment

First, we need to set up the environment with all the required libraries. We will be using `PyTorch` for the implementation of the model.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### 2. Dataset Preparation

For simplicity, we can create a synthetic dataset. You can either download an existing dataset of low-resolution text images or generate one.

We will create a dataset with both low-resolution and high-resolution pairs. Let's assume that the images are already resized.

```python
import os
import cv2
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms

class TextImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, lr_dir, hr_dir, transform=None):
        self.lr_images = [os.path.join(lr_dir, img) for img in os.listdir(lr_dir)]
        self.hr_images = [os.path.join(hr_dir, img) for img in os.listdir(hr_dir)]
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.lr_images)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        lr_image = cv2.imread(self.lr_images[idx], cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
        hr_image = cv2.imread(self.hr_images[idx], cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

        if self.transform:
            lr_image = self.transform(lr_image)
            hr_image = self.transform(hr_image)

        return lr_image, hr_image

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToPILImage(),
    transforms.Resize((128, 128)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

# Initialize dataset
lr_dir = "path_to_low_res_images"
hr_dir = "path_to_high_res_images"
dataset = TextImageDataset(lr_dir, hr_dir, transform)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)
```

### 3. SimCLR/BYOL Implementation for Feature Extraction

We’ll build the feature extraction part of the network using either **SimCLR** or **BYOL**. For simplicity, we'll use SimCLR here, but similar logic applies for BYOL.

SimCLR relies on contrastive learning and requires two augmented views of the same image.

#### SimCLR Feature Extractor

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class SimCLR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model='resnet18', out_dim=128):
        super(SimCLR, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
        self.encoder.fc = nn.Identity()  # Remove the classification layer
        self.projection_head = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, out_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        h = self.encoder(x)
        z = self.projection_head(h)
        return h, z

simclr_model = SimCLR()
```

### 4. Training the Super-Resolution Model

Once we extract features using SimCLR, we will train a separate network to learn the mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images.

#### Super-Resolution Model

```python
class SuperResolutionNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SuperResolutionNet, self).__init__()
        self.upscale = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=5, padding=2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, 1, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.upscale(x)

sr_model = SuperResolutionNet()
```

#### Training Loop

We can now train the model by minimizing the loss between the high-resolution and the output of the super-resolution model.

```python
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

optimizer = optim.Adam(sr_model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

def train_sr_model(dataloader, simclr_model, sr_model, epochs=20):
    simclr_model.eval()  # We don't train SimCLR
    sr_model.train()

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for lr_imgs, hr_imgs in dataloader:
            lr_imgs, hr_imgs = lr_imgs.unsqueeze(1).float(), hr_imgs.unsqueeze(1).float()

            # Forward pass through SimCLR encoder
            with torch.no_grad():
                _, lr_features = simclr_model(lr_imgs)

            # Super-resolution model
            sr_output = sr_model(lr_imgs)

            # Calculate loss and backpropagate
            loss = loss_fn(sr_output, hr_imgs)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            running_loss += loss.item()

        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {running_loss/len(dataloader)}")

train_sr_model(dataloader, simclr_model, sr_model)
```

### 5. Image Reconstruction

After training the model, we can now use it to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def infer_sr(lr_image, simclr_model, sr_model):
    lr_image = lr_image.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).float()  # Add batch and channel dimensions
    with torch.no_grad():
        _, lr_features = simclr_model(lr_image)
        sr_image = sr_model(lr_image)
    return sr_image.squeeze().cpu().numpy()

# Load a test low-res image and run inference
lr_image = cv2.imread('path_to_test_image', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
lr_image = transform(lr_image)

# Perform super-resolution
sr_image = infer_sr(lr_image, simclr_model, sr_model)

# Visualize the result
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(lr_image.squeeze(), cmap='gray')
plt.title('Low-Resolution')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(sr_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Super-Resolution')
plt.show()
```

### 6. Inference on New Images

The model is now ready to infer on any low-resolution image. Simply pass in the image, and the network will output the corresponding super-resolved image.

## Conclusion

In this post, we implemented a pipeline to perform **super-resolution** on images containing unstructured text using **self-supervised learning** techniques like **SimCLR**. We first extracted features using SimCLR and then trained a super-resolution model to upscale the images.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Self-Supervised Learning** can be leveraged for super-resolution without needing labeled datasets.
- **SimCLR** is effective for feature extraction in low-resolution images.
- The super-resolution network can be trained to reconstruct high-resolution images.

This method can be extended to other self-supervised learning techniques like **BYOL** or even to more advanced architectures for super-resolution.
