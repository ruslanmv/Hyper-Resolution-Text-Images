### Enhancing Low-Resolution Images with Unstructured Text Using Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformers

Super-resolution of images containing unstructured text can be a challenge, especially when dealing with low-resolution images. However, transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformers have emerged as powerful tools to enhance image resolution. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to create a Python script that uses these models to perform image super-resolution. 

We'll focus on two transformer-based architectures:

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Initially designed for classification, ViT can be adapted to super-resolution by treating image patches as input tokens.
- **Swin Transformer**: A hierarchical transformer model designed to capture both local and global information, making it suitable for super-resolution tasks.

### Steps to Perform Super-Resolution on Images with Transformers

We'll cover the following steps:
1. Set up the environment with necessary libraries.
2. Load the low-resolution image containing unstructured text.
3. Preprocess the image into patches (tokens) for transformer input.
4. Implement Vision Transformer (ViT) for image super-resolution.
5. Implement Swin Transformer for image super-resolution.
6. Post-process and visualize the results.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm matplotlib numpy opencv-python
```

### 1. Import Libraries

We'll begin by importing the required libraries for image processing and transformers.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import timm  # Pretrained models library
```

### 2. Load the Low-Resolution Image

Let's load a low-resolution image containing unstructured text. We'll use OpenCV for reading the image and matplotlib for visualization.

```python
def load_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    return image

def display_image(image, title='Image'):
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Load and display low-resolution image
low_res_image = load_image('low_res_text_image.jpg')
display_image(low_res_image, 'Low-Resolution Image')
```

### 3. Preprocess the Image into Patches

For Vision Transformers, we treat image patches as tokens. We'll split the image into patches and prepare them for input to the transformer.

```python
def preprocess_image(image, patch_size=16):
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToPILImage(),
        transforms.Resize((256, 256)),  # Resize to a fixed size
        transforms.ToTensor(),
    ])
    image_tensor = transform(image)
    
    # Create image patches (tokens)
    image_patches = image_tensor.unfold(1, patch_size, patch_size).unfold(2, patch_size, patch_size)
    image_patches = image_patches.contiguous().view(-1, 3, patch_size, patch_size)
    
    return image_patches

image_patches = preprocess_image(low_res_image)
print(f"Image Patches Shape: {image_patches.shape}")
```

### 4. Implement Vision Transformer for Image Super-Resolution

Now, we can adapt the Vision Transformer for super-resolution. We'll use the ViT model from the `timm` library and fine-tune it for our task.

```python
class ViT_SuperResolution(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model='vit_base_patch16_224'):
        super(ViT_SuperResolution, self).__init__()
        self.model = timm.create_model(pretrained_model, pretrained=True)
        self.model.head = nn.Linear(self.model.head.in_features, 3 * 16 * 16)  # Output the super-resolved patch
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.model(x)
        return x.view(-1, 3, 16, 16)  # Reshape to image patch

# Initialize and test the model with an image patch
vit_model = ViT_SuperResolution()
image_patch = image_patches[0].unsqueeze(0)  # Get one patch
output_patch = vit_model(image_patch)
print(f"Super-Resolved Patch Shape: {output_patch.shape}")
```

### 5. Implement Swin Transformer for Image Super-Resolution

Similarly, we'll implement the Swin Transformer for super-resolution. Swin Transformer processes images hierarchically, capturing both local and global information.

```python
class Swin_SuperResolution(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model='swin_base_patch4_window7_224'):
        super(Swin_SuperResolution, self).__init__()
        self.model = timm.create_model(pretrained_model, pretrained=True)
        self.model.head = nn.Linear(self.model.head.in_features, 3 * 16 * 16)  # Super-resolved output
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.model(x)
        return x.view(-1, 3, 16, 16)

# Initialize and test the Swin Transformer model
swin_model = Swin_SuperResolution()
output_patch_swin = swin_model(image_patch)
print(f"Super-Resolved Patch (Swin) Shape: {output_patch_swin.shape}")
```

### 6. Post-process and Reconstruct the Super-Resolved Image

After processing all patches through the model, we can reconstruct the full super-resolved image.

```python
def reconstruct_image(patches, image_size=(256, 256), patch_size=16):
    patches = patches.view(image_size[0] // patch_size, image_size[1] // patch_size, 3, patch_size, patch_size)
    patches = patches.permute(0, 3, 1, 4, 2).contiguous().view(image_size[0], image_size[1], 3)
    return patches

# Process all patches through the ViT model
super_resolved_patches = []
for patch in image_patches:
    patch = patch.unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension
    output_patch = vit_model(patch)
    super_resolved_patches.append(output_patch)

super_resolved_patches = torch.stack(super_resolved_patches).squeeze()
super_resolved_image = reconstruct_image(super_resolved_patches)

# Display the super-resolved image
display_image(super_resolved_image.permute(1, 2, 0).detach().numpy(), 'Super-Resolved Image')
```

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we demonstrated how to implement image super-resolution using Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformers. By splitting the low-resolution image into patches, we can process each patch through transformer models and reconstruct the super-resolved image. These transformer architectures enable better handling of complex image content such as unstructured text.

This method can be further fine-tuned by training the model on specific datasets for text-based super-resolution, improving the results even more. Feel free to experiment with different transformer architectures and settings to see how they impact your image super-resolution tasks.
